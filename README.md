<h2>About</h2>
This is a Sailfish application which toggles the default search engine to Duck Duck GO.

<b>I can't put this on Jolla Store because among other things it writes to the .mozembed directory</b>
<p>
Download the binary from the download directory.

<h2>Update 9</h2>
This application has stopped working on Update 9 because of several changes made to the Browser application and Settings pages. A more detailed description is located <a href="https://github.com/prplmnky/harbour-duckduckgo/issues/1">here</a>
<p>
I can't say fully, but development will probably stop until I (or a contributor) has time to track this down or until Update 10 offers some mechanism to extend the search engines or provides DuckDuckGo, natively.
