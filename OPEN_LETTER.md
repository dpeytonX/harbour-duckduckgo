To whom it may concern,

I created an application for DuckDuckGo Integration into the Sailfish Browser for the Jolla mobile phone.
The source is located at https://github.com/prplmnky/duckduckgo_sailfish

I read the guide at https://duck.co/help/company/partnerships
and I would like to make the case for violating the following Guidelines

* Please don't use DuckDuckGo in the title. (There can be exceptions so please contact us if you think you have a case for doing so). Mentioning us in the description is fine.
* Please don't use Dax (our mascot).

Since the app merely adds browser integration to Sailfish, I would like to know

(a) If I can get permission to use the DuckDuckGo logo and make derivative artwork for the application.

OR

(b) If someone is willing to take the ownership of the project.

Thank you for your time.

Sincerely,

Dametrious Peyton
