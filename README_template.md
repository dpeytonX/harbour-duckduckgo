<h2>About</h2>
This is a Sailfish application which toggles the default search engine to Duck Duck GO.

<b>Harbour store available</b>
<p>
Download the binary from the download directory.

<h2>Update 10 and Update 12</h2>
<p>
I was able to get DuckDuckGo the default search engine by updating the Bing search plugin to route to <a href="https://duckduckgo.com">https://duckduckgo.com</a> instead. You can search DuckDuckGo by setting Bing as the default search engine in the Settings > App > Browser area.
<b> Update 11 will not work.</b> I do not have an Update 11 device to test with but Jolla QA rejected this app. Update 12 is a developer release and is what I test with, however Jolla store limits the official store binary to Update 10. For now, you can download the binary from the download directory until I update the application's release version in Harbour.
